Manually
--------

Essex uses the newer and more advanced Module::Build rather than the
old ExtUtils::MakeMaker.  Also, both building and running Essex depend
on the YAML library.  To install these dependencies run:

   $ sudo cpan YAML Module::Build

Build Unto::Essex:

   $ perl Build.PL
   $ ./Build
   $ ./Build test
   $ sudo ./Build install

--------
Mac OS X
--------

First, make sure that the Developer Tools are installed.  This can 
be found on the Mac OS X DVD under "XCode Tools".  You must do this
before running CPAN for the first time so that all of the compiler
paths are found.  If not, run "cpan" and "o conf init" again.
